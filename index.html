            “I have created nothing really beautiful, really lasting, but if I can inspire one of these youngsters to develop the talent I know they possess, then my monument will be in their work.”—T. R. Poston, “Augusta Savage,” Metropolitan
            Magazine, Jan. 1935, n.p.<br><br>
            Originally titled Lift Every Voice and Sing, Augusta Savage’s 1939 World’s Fair commission, “The Harp”, symbolizes the Black American experience as revealed in James Weldon Johnson’s poem of the same name.<br><br>
            The once 16 foot plaster statue created in Savage’s Harlem studio depicts twelve Black robed figures with their mouths open in a singing-like position under the hand of god. The composition of “The Harp” alludes to the legacy of Black
            music traditions, the connected struggle of Black people, and our quest for liberation. The sculpture asserts that progress for the group is obtainable. Savage’s contributions both as educator and artist helped to establish a legacy of
            Black artists whose work is reflective of valued communal practices, evident in the legacy and inspiration of The Harp.<br><br>
            Smaller bronze versions of the statue were later created by Savage.

            ‘The Liberation of Aunt Jemima” by artist Betye Saar depicts the historically derogatory “mammy” figure in a powerful and warrior-like fashion. While the traditional mammy figure and stereotype is considered subservient and compliant, the
            figure that Saar creates wields a rifle in her left hand. The rifle serves as an indication of the rejection of the conditions and roles that have kept Black people oppressed and enslaved.

It’s here that the Bakraka turns the poem into a call to action, as the state Black people are in is not the state of our origin or creation.

          <p class="collapsibleText">The original Juneteenth Flag was created by Ben Haith and Lisa Jeanne Graf in 1997. It was created to commemorate June 19, 1865, the day that the enslaved population in Galveston, Texas were notified of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. The colors of the flag, red, white, and blue, serve as a reminder that the enslaved and their descendants are indeed Americans. The white star represents Texas which is also known as the Lone Star State while the arc of red at the bottom of the flag indicates new horizons and futures to be reached by African American. The star burst outline symbolizes the birth of a new star and beginning. </p>
